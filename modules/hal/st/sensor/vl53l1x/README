Origin:

Status:
   version 2.4.5

Purpose:
   ST Microelectonics official API to use vl53l1x sensor.

Description:
   This library written by STMicroelectronics is dedicated to vl53l1x time of flight sensor.

   This library is called from the vl53l1x driver and is kept transparent for user.
   User is calling a standard Zephyr driver and then the driver makes some calls to this library.

   In order to fit with Zephyr rules and simplify version updates, we have done a minimum of modifications :
      - split headers and source to inc/src
      - keep only API directory
        (remove documentation and samples, see ST website for this)

   In order to use this library, you have to :
      * define CONFIG_HAS_STLIB and CONFIG_VL53L1X
      * use NEWLIB_LIBC in prj.conf (needed for abs function)
      * include vl53l1_api.h and vl53l1_platform.h in the driver .h

Dependencies:
   This package depends on Zephyr I2C implementation and is linked statically.
   This library will be used by a standard Zephyr driver.
