General Notes for Cadence/Tensillica HAL Updates
================================================

The xtensa HAL is supplied by Cadence/Tensillica and is indended to support all
xtensa ISA configurations used by different devices.

Zephyr needs certain HAL modifications for ease of management for use within
Zephyr and these changes need to be applied to any HAL updates from Cadence.

1) Remove usage of __SPLIT__ from HAL build.
--------------------------------------------

The HAL build script creates individual source files per functions by defining
__SPLIT_* macros and including corresponding source files, in an attempt to
compile one function per file. These should be removed. See
84ff6039fc8f435551bb7915e098184c95fa24f2 and
16324fd861596f57517524cd9d6fc66b077db4e8.


This file should be updated accordingly to reflect any new changes required
in new HALs.
