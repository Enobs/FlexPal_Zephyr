 *
 * @brief Compass functions based on magenetometer data.
 *
 * This modules provides functions to convert magnetometer readings -- ideally
 * from a data source that has been calibrated to remove hard-iron and
 * soft-iron errors -- into magnetic bearing and/or true bearing.
 *
 * Magnetic bearing is determined in relation to magnetic north, whose
 * position will vary from day to day depending on the latitude, longitude and
 * date.
 *
 * True (or geographic) bearing is determined in relation to true north --
 * sometimes referred to as geographic north -- which is the fixed, physical
 * north pole.
 *
 * The relationship between the true north and the shifting magnetic
 * north is called the 'absolute bearing', and is usually calculated as
 * a dms (decimal, minute, second) 'declination', given a specific latitude,
 * longitude and date. The calculated declination can then be applied to the
 * magnetic bearing measured by the magnetometer, and adjusted to account for
 * the difference (positive or negative) between the two.
 *
 * Several models exist to represent the current position of magnetic north
 * relative to true north, each with an associated range of time since the
 * models need to be updated over timee (i.e. WMM 2019-2024, IGRF 1590-2024,
 * EMM 2000-2019, etc.). These models are generally too complex to implement
 * in small embedded systems, so the 'declination' should be calculated using
 * an appropriate exterrnal tool, and used in the embedded systeem as an
 * updateable input.
 *
 * Since declination is usually represented in dms (rather than decimal
 * degrees), a helper function is provided to convert from dms (ex.:
 * 2Â° 13' 0" East) to decimal degrees (2.216667 in this case).

 * @brief Calculates geographic north (AKA true bearing) based on the supplied
 *        magnetometer data, and the magentic declination.
 *
 * This function first calculates the magnetic bearing, determined based on the
 * supplied magnetometer values 'm', and adjusts it for the provided magnetic
 * declination 'dec' (in degrees), which represents the difference between
 * geographic north of the earth and magentic north at a given latitude and
 * date. The final result represents the true bearing or rather the deviation
 * from true north in degrees.
 *
 * The exact magnetic declination changes over time and location, and can't be
 * easily modeled on small embedded systems, so it must be determined from an
 * external source.
 *
 * To find the value of the magnetic declination angle based on the date,
 * latitude, longitude and altitude, one can use the following
 * online calculator:
