# Zephyr Scientific Library (zscilib)

[![API Documentation](doc/img/badge_api.svg)][1]

[1]: https://zephyrproject-rtos.github.io/zscilib/

The **Zephyr Scientific Library (zscilib)** is an attempt to provide a set of
functions useful for scientific computing, data analysis and data manipulation
in the context of resource constrained embedded hardware devices.

It is written entirely in C, and while the main development target for the
library is the [Zephyr Project](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr),
it tries to be as portable as possible, and a standalone reference project
is included to use this library in non-Zephyr-based projects.

This version of zscilib has been developed and tested against **Zephyr 3.3.0**.

## Motivation

As the processing power of small, embedded MCUs increases and costs fall, more
computation can be done on the endnode itself. This allows for more of the
'complex' data analysis that used to take place at the PC or server level
(data aggregation, statistical analysis, etc.) to be done in less time,
using less data storage, and at a lower overall processing cost on small,
embedded devices.

> A key goal of zscilib is to allow more data processing to happen on the
  endnode.

By generating scientifically-relevant data points (standard SI units,
pre-filtered data, etc.) directly on the endnode, zscilib aims to be a bridge
between raw data and more numerically complex toolkits like `gsl`, `numpy`
or `R`.

#### What makes zscilib distinct?

Numerous high quality, mature, open source scientific libraries already exist:

- [GNU scientific library (gsl)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- [Lis (Library of Iterative Solvers for linear systems)](https://github.com/anishida/lis)
- [CMSIS-DSP](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/DSP/html/index.html)

Despite the wealth of mature functions in these existing libraries, though,
they tend to have the following two problems in an embedded context:

- They are overly broad and resource intensive (GSL, etc.), and thus aren't
  appropriate for small, resource constrained devices like the ARM Cortex M
  family.
- They are missing many of the domain-specific features required to convert
  raw sensor data into actionable information (CMSIS-DSP, Lis).

The second item is of particular importance, since the goal of embedded systems
is often 'sensing' via raw data, correlating that data, and acting on the final
data points or passing them on for further analysis.

CMSIS-DSP contains a number of highly efficient algorithms for filtering
raw sensor data, but it doesn't offer any domain-specific assistance converting
filtered accelerometer vectors into orientation data, for example, or reading
a set of photodiodes and converting that data into a useful photometric value
like lux. It is excellent at 'conditioning' data, but not at 'understanding' it.

zscilib aims to find a middle ground between these two, allowing for richer
processing of raw data, but within the confines and limitations of the class
of microcontrollers commonly used on low-cost sensor endnodes.

## Quick Start: Standalone

A few makefile-based projects are included in `samples/standalone` showing
how zscilib can be used independent of Zephyr.

If you already have an appropriate GNU toolchain and build tools (`make`, etc.)
installed, you can simply execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd samples/standalone/svd_pinv
$ make
$ bin/zscilib
  Hello, zscilib!
  ...
```

## Quick Start: Zephyr RTOS

### Running a sample application

To run one of the sample applications using qemu, run the following commands:

> Be sure to run `source zephyr/zephyr-env.sh` (OS X or Linux) or
  `.\zephyr\zephyr-env.cmd` (Windows) before the commands below! This also
  assumes `qemu-system-arm` is available on your local system.

```
$ west build -p -b mps2_an521 \
  modules/lib/zscilib/samples/matrix/mult -t run
...
*** Booting Zephyr OS build zephyr-v2.6.0-536-g89212a7fbf5f  ***
zscilib matrix mult demo

mtx multiply output (4x3 * 3x4 = 4x4):

14.000000 17.000000 20.000000 23.000000 
35.000000 44.000000 53.000000 62.000000 
56.000000 71.000000 86.000000 101.000000 
7.000000 9.000000 11.000000 13.000000 
```

Press **`CTRL+A`** then **`x`** to quit qemu.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests for this library, run the following command:

```bash
$ twister --inline-logs -p mps2_an521 -T modules/lib/zscilib/tests
```

See the `tests` folder for further details.

To run compliance tests to make sure submitted code matches Zephyr PR
requirements, run this (updating `HEAD~2` for the number of commits to check,
or setting it to `origin/master..` to check everything):

```bash
$ ../../../zephyr/scripts/ci/check_compliance.py \
  -m Gitlint -m Identity -m Nits -m pylint -m checkpatch \
  -c HEAD~2..
```

### Debugging with QEMU

If you wish to debug using QEMU (and with minor variation actual hardware),
you can run the following commands to start a new GDB debug session.

> For an overview of debugging in GDB, you may find the following presentation
  useful: [LVC21-308: Essential ARM Cortex-M Debugging with GDB][LV21-308]

[LV21-308]: https://connect.linaro.org/resources/lvc21/lvc21-308/

In one terminal window, run:

```bash
$ west build -p auto -b mps2_an521 modules/lib/zscilib/samples/matrix/pinv
```

Once the ELF file has been built, we can start a GDB server on the default
`1234` socket, and wait for a new connection via:

```bash
$ cd build
$ ninja debugserver
```

In a new terminal window, connect to the GDB server via:

```bash
$ cd <zephyr_path>
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb-py \
  --eval-command="target remote localhost:1234" \
  --se=build/zephyr/zephyr.elf
```

> The `-py` extension is optional, and makes use of a version of GDB from the
  ARM GNU toolchain releases that enables Python scripts to be used with your
  debug sessions. See the [LVC21-308][LV21-308] presentation at the top of this
  section for details.

From here, you can start debugging with the `(gdb)` prompt.

For example:

```
(gdb) b main
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, main () at modules/lib/zscilib/samples/matrix/pinv/src/main.c:70
70              printf("\n\nzscilib pseudo-inverse demo\n\n");
(gdb) n
72              pinv_demo();
(gdb) step
pinv_demo () at modules/lib/zscilib/samples/matrix/pinv/src/main.c:25
25              zsl_real_t vi[18 * 3] = {
(gdb) n
... 
(gdb) quit
```

## Floating-Point Usage

zscilib can be configured to make use of single-precision (32-bit) or
double-precision (64-bit) floating point values via the
`CONFIG_ZSL_SINGLE_PRECISION` flag, which will determine the size of
`zsl_real_t` used throughout the library. The default setting for this
flag is `n`, meaning **64-bit values are used by default**.

There is a tradeoff between the added range and precision that 64-bit
(double-precision) floating point values offer, and the memory and performance
gains of the smaller, less-precise but faster 32-bit (single-precision)
operations.

> Due to the reduced precision of single-precision values, certain complex
  functions in zscilib are **only available when double-precision is enabled**
  (PINV, SVD, etc.).

### Comparison

#### Single-Precision (32-bit) Floats

- Require 4 bytes of memory to store
- Have about **7 significant digits of precision**
- Have a range of about 1.E-36 to 1.E+36
- HW acceleration available on Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M7 and most Cortex-M33 MCUs.
- Generates smaller, more efficient code than double

#### Double-Precision (64-bit) Floats

- Requires 8 bytes of memory to store
- Have about **13 significant digits of precision**
- Have a range of about 1.E-303 to 1.E+303
- HW acceleration generally only available on large, Cortex-M7 MCUs
- Generates larger code, with more processing overhead per operation

### Float Stack Usage in Zephyr

The sample code in this library typically has the `CONFIG_FPU` option set,
meaning that floating-point support is configured for
[Unshared FP registers mode][2]. This mode is used when the application
has a **single thread** that uses floating point registers.

If your application makes use of **multiple threads**, and more than one of
these threads uses floating-point operations, you should also enable the
`CONFIG_FPU_SHARING` config flag, which configures the kernel for
[Shared FP registers mode][3]. In this mode, the floating point registers are
saved and restored during each context switch, even when the associated threads
are not using them. This feature comes at the expense of an extra 72 bytes of
stack memory per stack frame (`s0..s15` + `FPCSR`, plus an alignment word
to ensure that the stack pointer is double-word aligned).

### Measurement API (v0.2.0)

The `zsl_measurement` struct is a proof of concept attempt at representing
measurements in a concise but unambiguous manner.

It consists of:

- A **measurement type** (Base Type + Extended Type)
- The **SI unit** it uses (SI Unit Type)
- The specific **C type** used to represent it in memory (C Type)
- Additional meta-data to help interpret the measurement payload

There is an option to adjust the measurement's **scale** in +/- 10^n steps
(Scale Factor) from the default SI unit and scale indicated by the SI Unit
Type. For example, if 'Ampere' is indicated as the SI unit, the measurement
could indicate that the value is in uA by setting the scale factor to -6.

## Architecture-Specific Optimisations

Basic tooling has been added to allow for optimised architecture-specific
implementations of key functions in assembly.

At present, this feature isn't being actively used or developed, but an aim
of zscilib is to add optimised versions of key functions to try to get the
best possible performance out of limited resources.

Initial optimisation will target the **Arm Cortex-M** family of devices and the
**Thumb** and **Thumb-2** instruction sets, though other architectures can be
accommodated if necessary or useful.

## Code Style

Since the primary target of this codebase is running as a module in
[Zephyr OS][CS0], it follows the same [coding style][CS1], which is itself
based on the [Linux kernel coding style][CS2].

You can format the source code to match this style automatically using the
[uncrustify][CS3] command line tool, which has plugins available for many
common text editors (Atom Beautify, for example).
