	int "RTT buffer size up"

	range 0 1048576
	help
	  Defines the size of the "up" RTT buffer (target -> host) to use for writing
	  the trace data, for RTT buffer 1 or higher.
	  
	  This setting is ignored for RTT buffer 0, which can't be reconfigured
	  in runtime and therefore hard-coded to use the defines in SEGGER_RTT_Conf.h.
	  
	  Default buffer size for Tracealyzer is 5000 bytes.
	  If you have a stand-alone J-Link probe, the can be decreased to around 1 KB.
	  But integrated J-Link OB interfaces are slower and needs about 5-10 KB,
	  depending on the amount of data produced.

	  commands from Tracealyzer, for RTT buffer 1 or higher.
	  
	  Default buffer size for Tracealyzer is 32 bytes.

	int "RTT buffer up index"
	default 1
	range 0 32
	help
	  Defines the RTT buffer to use for writing the trace data. Make sure that
	  the PC application has the same setting (File->Settings).
	  
	  Default: 1
	  
	  We don't recommend using RTT buffer 0, since mainly intended for terminals.
	  If you prefer to use buffer 0, it must be configured in SEGGER_RTT_Conf.h.

	help
	  This stream port for J-Link streaming relies on SEGGER RTT, that contains an
	  internal RAM buffer read by the J-Link probes during execution.
	  
	  Possible values:
	    - PERCEPIO_TRC_CFG_STREAM_PORT_RTT_MODE_BLOCK_IF_FIFO_FULL
	    - PERCEPIO_TRC_CFG_STREAM_PORT_RTT_MODE_NO_BLOCK_SKIP (default)
	  
	  Using PERCEPIO_TRC_CFG_STREAM_PORT_RTT_MODE_BLOCK_IF_FIFO_FULL ensure that you get a
	  complete and valid trace. This may however cause blocking if your streaming
	  interface isn't fast enough, which may disturb the real-time behavior.
	  
	  We therefore recommend PERCEPIO_TRC_CFG_STREAM_PORT_RTT_MODE_NO_BLOCK_SKIP. In this mode,
	  Tracealyzer will report lost events if the transfer is not
	  fast enough. In that case, try increasing the size of the "up buffer".

	  Sets if RTT should write without locking or not when writing
	  RTT data. This should normally be disabled with an exception being
	  Zephyr, where the SEGGER RTT locks aren't necessary and causes
	  problems if enabled.
