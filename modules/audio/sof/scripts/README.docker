The docker container provided in docker_build sets up a build environment for
building Sound Open Firmware. A working docker installation is needed to run
the docker build container.

Note: In order to run docker as non sudo/root user please run.

sudo usermod -aG docker your-user-name

Then logout and login again.

Quick Start:

First, build the docker container. This step needs to be done initially and
when the toolchain or alsa dependencies are updated.

cd scripts/docker_build

./docker-build.sh

After the container is built, it can be used to run the scripts.

To build for tigerlake:
./scripts/docker-run.sh ./scripts/xtensa-build-all.sh -l tgl
or (may need password test0000 for rimage install)
./scripts/docker-run.sh ./scripts/xtensa-build-all.sh tgl

To rebuild the topology and logger:
./scripts/docker-run.sh ./scripts/build-tools.sh

An incremental sof.git build:
./scripts/docker-run.sh make

Or enter a shell:
./scripts/docker-run.sh bash
