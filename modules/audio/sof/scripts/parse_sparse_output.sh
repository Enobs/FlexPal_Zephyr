# "sparse" is not designed for automated testing: its exit code is
# mostly useless. So this script extracts from its output the most
# important messages instead and returns 1 if any is found.

# As of Sep. 2022, sparse's exit status is by default always zero even
# when there is an error, see check_symbols() in sparse.c. There is a
# -DEXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wsparse-error option that returns non-zero... for any
# warning even the most harmless one and it seems to stops on the first
# one. SOF has hundreds of sparse warnings now.
